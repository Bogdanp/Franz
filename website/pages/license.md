This Agreement is a legal agreement for the licensed use of the Franz
application ("Franz") between you, either an individual or as an
authorized representative of a legal entity ("you") and CLEARTYPE SRL,
a limited liability company established and existing under the laws of
Romania ("CLEARTYPE"). By downloading, installing, copying or otherwise
using all or any portion of Franz you agree to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you
are not authorized or licensed to use Franz.

# LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your payment
of the required license fee, CLEARTYPE grants to you a limited,
non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as expressly permitted in this
Agreement) right and license (during the term of this Agreement to
install, activate, and use this version of Franz for your personal use
or internal business purposes ("License") either (a) as one installed
instance of Franz on one device, or (b) installed on up to three (3)
different devices for your use on no more than one device at a time.
This License does not allow multiple users to use Franz on multiple
computers unless a separate license has been purchased for each user.
This License will apply to all updates to the application, if any, made
generally available by CLEARTYPE without charge, provided, however, that
upon downloading and installing an update to the Franz application, your
right to use prior versions of Franz will terminate and earlier versions
may no longer be used. This License will remain in effect unless and
until this Agreement is either terminated according to its terms or
superseded by a new agreement between the parties.

This License to use Franz is limited to the current major release of
Franz. CLEARTYPE will at its sole discretion decide when a version
of Franz will be considered a new major release that requires a new
purchase or upgrade license. CLEARTYPE reserves the right to change the
terms of this Agreement in any future major or minor release of Franz.
If you do not agree to accept the changes made in the Agreement, you may
not use the new release of Franz but your License under this Agreement
to your existing version of Franz will not be affected.
