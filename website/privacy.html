        <h3>Use and processing of collected information</h3>
        <p>
          In order to make the Franz Application and Services
          available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
          collect and use certain Personal Information.  If you do not
          provide the information that we request, we may not be able
          to provide you with the requested products or services. Any
          of the information we collect from you may be used for the
          following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
          <li>Deliver products or services</li>
          <li>Improve products and services</li>
          <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
          <li>Enforce our terms and conditions and policies</li>
          <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
          <li>Maintain and operate the Franz Application and Services</li>
          <li>Provide you with newsletters and marketing information if you opt to receive such materials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Processing your Personal Information depends on how you
          interact with the Franz Application and Services,
          where you are located in the world and if one of the
          following applies: (i) if you have given your consent for
          one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not
          apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information in a
          certain manner is subject to and prohibited by the
          California Consumer Privacy Act or European General Data
          Protection Regulation (“GDPR”); (ii) if provision of
          information is necessary related to entering into and
          performing an agreement with you; (iii) processing is
          necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (iv) if
          processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
          interests pursued by us or by a third party.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Note that under some legislation we may be allowed to
          process information until you object to such processing (by
          opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other
          of the following legal bases described in this policy. In
          any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal
          basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
          whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory
          or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
          enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>"Do Not Track" Settings</h3>
        <p>
          Please note that our website may not recognize or take
          action in response to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals from web
          browser settings.  At this time, there is no universally
          accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT
          signal is detected.  In the event a final standard is
          established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to
          these signals.  For more detailed information about cookies,
          Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit
          http://www.youronlinechoices.com.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or
          receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply
          with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we
          believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
          protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of
          others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government
          request.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          In the event we go through a business transition, such as a
          merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or
          a portion of our assets related to the Franz Application,
          your user account, and Personal Information will likely be
          among the assets transferred.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Retention of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We will retain and use your Personal Information for the
          period necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
          resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer
          retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use
          any anonymized or aggregated data derived from or
          incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
          delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
          personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal
          Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to
          access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and
          the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the
          expiration of the retention period.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Transfer of information</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, data transfers may involve
          transferring and storing your information in a country other
          than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal
          basis of information transfers to a country outside the
          European Union or to any international organization governed
          by public international law or set up by two or more
          countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures
          taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such
          transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the
          relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using
          the information provided in the contact section.

          Application and Services, please contact us. You must also
          be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of

          subscribe at any time.  We are committed to keeping your
          e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email
          address to any third parties except as allowed in the
          information use and processing section or for the purposes
          of utilizing a third party provider to send such emails. We

        <br/>

        <h3>Information security</h3>
        <p>

          controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized
          access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable

          network can be guaranteed as secure. Therefore, while we
          strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge
          that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the
          Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security,
          integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
          exchanged between you and the Franz Application and Services

          data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third
          party, despite best efforts.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Data breach</h3>
        <p>

          Application and Services has been compromised or users
          Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third
          parties as a result of external activity, including, but not
          limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right
          to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not
          limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
          notification to and cooperation with law enforcement
          authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make
          reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we
          believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user
          as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required
          by law.
        </p>
